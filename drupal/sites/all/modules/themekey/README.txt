Description
===========

ThemeKey is meant to be a generic theme switching module. It
allows you to switch the theme for different paths and based
on object properties (e.g. node field values). It can also be
easily extended to support additional paths or properties as
exposed by other modules.

Documentation for users and developers is very sparse at the
moment. I hope to complete the docs in the next few weeks.
Thanks for your patience :)
